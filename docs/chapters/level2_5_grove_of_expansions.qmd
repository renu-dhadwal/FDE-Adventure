### Scene: The Grove of Expansions

Ananya and Acharya leave the boats behind and walk into a quiet grove of trees. The branches seem to stretch infinitely, each sprouting smaller and smaller twigs.  

**Ananya**: These trees look endless, Acharya. Each branch divides into more branches, and so on forever.  

**Acharya Anvaya**: Exactly, Ananya. Just as trees expand endlessly, so too can a function expand in terms of its derivatives. You know this in ordinary calculus as the **Taylor expansion**.  

**Ananya**: Yes, where a function $f(t)$ is expressed as an infinite sum involving its derivatives at $t=0$.

## From Classical to Fractional Taylor Expansion

<div class="rule-box">

**Classical Taylor formula** (order $m$):  

$$
f(t) = \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}\, t^k \;+\; R_m(t),
$$  

with remainder  

$$
R_m(t) = \frac{1}{(m-1)!} \int_0^t (t-\tau)^{m-1} f^{(m)}(\tau)\, d\tau.
$$

</div>

**Acharya Anvaya**: Now, in the language of memory, we can generalize this formula. Instead of the $m$-th derivative, we allow a fractional order $\alpha$.  

<div class="rule-box">

**Fractional Taylor formula (Caputo)**  

For $m-1 < \alpha \le m$,  

$$
f(t) = \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}\, t^k
\;+\; \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)} \int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\alpha-1}\, {}^C D_t^\alpha f(\tau)\, d\tau.
$$

</div>

**Ananya**: So the beginning looks like the classical expansion, but the remainder now contains a **fractional derivative** instead of an integer one.  

**Acharya Anvaya**: Precisely. The forest of expansions stretches into the fractional realm ðŸŒ¿. The remainder term is a *memory integral*, showing how past values influence the approximation.

## Example: Exponential Function

**Ananya**: Can we try this with a familiar function, like $f(t)=e^t$?  

**Acharya Anvaya**: Of course. Note that $f^{(k)}(0)=1$ for all $k$.  

<div class="rule-box">

For $m=1$, $\alpha \in (0,1]$, the expansion is:  

$$
e^t = 1 \;+\; \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)} \int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\alpha-1}\, {}^C D_t^\alpha e^\tau\, d\tau.
$$

But ${}^C D_t^\alpha e^\tau = 1^\alpha e^\tau = e^\tau$,  
so the remainder is  

$$
\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)} \int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\alpha-1} e^\tau\, d\tau.
$$

</div>

**Ananya**: That integral looks like a weighted memory of the exponential.  

**Acharya Anvaya**: Exactly. For $\alpha=1$, it reduces to the ordinary Taylor remainder.
