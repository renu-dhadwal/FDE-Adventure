What lies in this temple?\nAcharya Anvaya: This is the Temple of Smriti, or memory. It contains the secrets of memory, the key to which lies in the idea of the fractional integral.\nAnanya: Hmm… the integral is by itself a sort of memory, isn’t it?

    "text": "2.2 The Riemann–Liouville Integral\nThe temple wall shimmers again, and new verses appear, written in flowing Sanskrit:\n“यथा यथा संचितं स्मर्यते, तथा तथैव अनन्तं स्मृतिः — As memory gathers step by step, it stretches into infinity.”\nAcharya Anvaya: The formula you just derived for integer \\(n\\), Ananya, is not bound to whole numbers alone. The Great ones in modern times, Riemann from Germany and Liouville from France extended it further. This is known today as the Riemann–Liouville fractional integral:\n\nRiemann–Liouville fractional integral\n\\[\n(I^\\alpha f)(t) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\int_0^t (t-\\tau)^{\\alpha-1} f(\\tau)\\, d\\tau, \\qquad \\alpha &gt; 0.\n\\]\n\nAnanya: So it is the same as the Cauchy formula, but with \\((n-1)!\\) replaced by \\(\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\) — allowing \\(\\alpha\\) to be any positive real number?\nAcharya Anvaya: Exactly. This was the leap — from repeated integer steps to a smooth continuum of memory depths. Each value of \\(\\alpha\\) encodes how strongly the past is remembered.\nAcharya Anvaya: Just as the smriti texts preserve memory across centuries, a fractional integral preserves traces of all past values of a function. But the weight of remembrance fades, just as stories fade with time.\nAnanya: So the past influences the present, but the farther back in time we go, the weaker its pull?\nAcharya Anvaya: Precisely. Like the echo of a conch in the Himalayas — recent notes ring loud, but the first strike still whispers faintly.\n\n\n2.2.1 Mini-Quest 1: The Half-Memory\n\nEvaluate \\(I^{1/2}(1)\\).\nAnswer:\n\\[\n(I^{1/2}1)(t) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\, t^{1/2}.\n\\]\n\nAcharya Anvaya: Well done, Ananya. You have grasped the essence of fractional memory. You now hold the Key of Smriti (Memory). With it, the temple doors open to the next journey.\nThe fractional integral is like oral tradition: newer retellings weigh more, but the first telling is never fully erased.\nA smaller \\(\\alpha\\) preserves distant past more strongly — like stories handed down for centuries.\nA larger \\(\\alpha\\) emphasizes the near past — like yesterday’s lived experiences.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Mini-Quest 2: Comparing Memories\n\nWhich value of \\(\\alpha\\) remembers the distant past most strongly?\n\nChoice A: \\(\\alpha = 0.2\\)\n\nChoice B: \\(\\alpha = 0.5\\)\n\nChoice C: \\(\\alpha = 0.9\\)\n\nAnswer: Since the kernel is \\((t-\\tau)^{\\alpha - 1}\\), smaller \\(\\alpha\\) means slower decay. So the answer is A.\n\nAnanya: But where do we see such memory in materials?",

    "text": "2.3 Example: Stress–Strain in Viscoelastic Fluids\nAcharya Anvaya: Have you heard of Hooke’s law in solids?\nAnanya: Yes! It says:\n\\[\n\\sigma(t) = E \\, \\varepsilon(t).\n\\]\nThe stress responds instantly to strain.\nAcharya Anvaya: But how does this change for flowing materials?\nAnanya: From what I know, for purely viscous fluids, Newton’s law governs:\n\\[\n\\sigma(t) = \\eta \\, \\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt}(t).\n\\]\nAcharya Anvaya: Here stress depends only on the rate of strain at the present moment.\nAnanya: So both Hooke’s law and Newton’s law speak only of the present. They have no memory of what came before?\nAcharya Anvaya: Exactly. But the world of polymers is different. These are viscoelastic materials. Their stress at time \\(t\\) remembers the entire history of strain. It is written as:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma(t) = \\int_0^t G(t-\\tau)\\,\\frac{d\\varepsilon}{d\\tau}(\\tau)\\,d\\tau,\n\\]\nwhere \\(G\\) is the relaxation kernel — the weight of memory.\n\nAnanya: So the kernel is like the echoing chamber of the temple — weighing the voices of the past according to distance in time?\nAcharya Anvaya: Precisely. If \\(G\\) is exponential we get Maxwell-type models. Experiments often show a power-law:\n\n\\[\nG(t-\\tau)\\sim (t-\\tau)^{-\\alpha}, \\qquad 0&lt;\\alpha&lt;1.\n\\]\n\nAnanya: Then stress never completely forgets — the echoes fade slowly.\nAcharya Anvaya: Substituting this kernel gives a fractional constitutive law:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma(t)=\\eta_\\alpha\\,D_t^\\alpha\\varepsilon(t),\n\\]\nwhere \\(D_t^\\alpha\\) is a fractional derivative of the strain.\n\n\nAnanya: Oh! But what exactly is a fractional derivative? I have never seen that symbol before!\nAcharya Anvaya: For guidance:\n\nFor \\(\\alpha = 1\\):\n\\[\nD_t^1 \\varepsilon(t) = \\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt}(t),\n\\]\nthe ordinary derivative, as in Newton’s law of viscosity.\nFor \\(\\alpha = 0\\):\n\\[\nD_t^0 \\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon(t),\n\\]\ni.e. the function itself, as in Hooke’s law of elasticity.\nFor \\(0&lt;\\alpha&lt;1\\):\n\\(D_t^\\alpha\\) interpolates smoothly between these two extremes, capturing behavior that is partly elastic and partly viscous (viscoelastic behavior).\n\n\nAnanya: So when \\(\\alpha=0\\), the memory is eternal — purely elastic. When \\(\\alpha=1\\), memory vanishes quickly — purely viscous. And for \\(0&lt;\\alpha&lt;1\\), we have viscoelasticity, with fading memory that bridges the two.\nAcharya Anvaya: Exactly! Thus, the language of fractional calculus is the scripture that describes memory in matter — echoing from the temple walls into the world of flowing polymers.\nAcharya Anvaya: We will learn about fractional derivatives as we go further to the The River of Derivatives.\n\nNarrator: With the Key of Smriti in hand, Ananya steps through the temple gates. The path ahead leads to the River of Derivatives.",

    "text": "6.1 Room 1 — The Gates of Exponentials\nThe gates of the palace are tall and bright, inscribed with countless copies of the familiar function (e^t). Ananya and Acharya Anvay pause at the threshold.\nAnanya: “This part feels familiar. The exponential is everywhere. But why does it appear so naturally in differential equations?”\nAcharya Anvay: “Because the exponential is the eigenfunction of the derivative operator. Let’s recall the simplest case.”\nA golden plaque reads:\n[ y’(t) = y(t), y(0)=y_0. ]\nTwo standard derivations\n\nSeparation of variables.\n[ =dt y(t)=y_0 e^{t}. ]\nLaplace transform.\n[ L{y’(t)}(s)=sy(s)-y_0. ] So [ sy(s)-y_0=y(s)y(s)=, ] and inversion yields (y(t)=y_0 e^{t}).\n\nAnanya: “So (e^{t}) repeats itself under differentiation — that’s why it rules this gate.”\nAcharya Anvay: “Exactly. Exponential is the natural solution whenever we deal with first-order derivatives. But the palace has deeper chambers. What if the derivative is fractional? What will replace the exponential then?”\nThe gates open with this question, inviting them into the Hall of Fractional Derivatives.",

    "text": "6.2 Room 2 — The Hall of Fractional Derivatives\nAs the gates close behind them, Ananya and Acharya Anvay enter a high-ceilinged hall. Strange symbols line the marble walls — integrals stretching into the past, and powers of (s) rising into the ceiling. At the centre is a pedestal with a single formula glowing.\nAnanya: “This isn’t the derivative I know. The inscription looks like the Laplace transform, but something’s different.”\nAcharya Anvay: “Yes. This is the Caputo fractional derivative. Remember, the Laplace transform itself is unchanged: [ L{f(t)}(s) = _0e{-st} f(t),dt. ] But when we apply it to a fractional derivative, the transform rule changes.”\nThe pedestal shows the key identity for the Caputo derivative (for (0&lt;)):\n[ L{{}^C D_t^f(t)}(s) ;=; s^f(s) - s^{} f(0). ]\nAnanya: “So instead of (sf(s)-f(0)) we now get (sf(s)-s{}f(0))?”\nAcharya Anvay: “Exactly. That single change — the appearance of (s^) — is what transforms the entire palace. It means fractional derivatives take us from linear powers of (s) to fractional ones.”\nThey step to a carved arch showing the fractional analogue of the exponential ODE:\n[ {}^C D_t^y(t) = y(t), y(0)=y_0. ]\nApplying the Laplace identity gives the stone inscription:\n[ s^y(s) - s^{} y_0 = y(s) y(s) = . ]\nAnanya: “The denominator is (s^-), not (s-). The shape of the solution must be completely different!”\nAcharya Anvay: “In the next room you will meet the function that inverts this transform — the true master of this palace: the Mittag–Leffler function.”",

Upon it glows a new formula — one Ananya has never seen before.\nAnanya: “This looks like a series… but the denominator has () functions!”\nOn the column is written the defining series:\n[ E_{,}(z) ;=; _{k=0}^, &gt;0, C, ]\nand the single-parameter form\n[ E_(z):=E_{,1}(z). ]\nAcharya Anvay: “This is the Mittag–Leffler function. It is the natural generalisation of the exponential.”\nAnanya: “If I take (, ) I get [ E_{1,1}(z)={k=0}^={k=0}=ez. ] So the exponential is a special doorway inside this chamber!”\nThe surrounding walls light up with short plaques:\n\nConvergence / entireness: the series converges for all (zC); (E_{,}) is entire.\n\nValue at zero: (E_(0)=1).\n\nOperational identity (Laplace): [ L{ E_(t^)}(s) = , ] which exactly inverts the transform found in Room 2.\n\nAnanya: “So (E_) is exactly the inverse Laplace transform of the expression from the Hall of Fractional Derivatives.”\nAcharya Anvay: “Yes. It is the eigenfunction of the fractional derivative in the same way the exponential is the eigenfunction of the ordinary derivative.”\nThey stand quietly, absorbing the fact that what looked like a small change in the differentiation rule leads to an entire new landscape of functions.\n\n\n6.3.1 Navigation note\n\nNext: Room 4 — The Gallery of Properties (asymptotics, growth, spectral representation, monotonicity).\n\nIf you want, I can place Room 4 into the same .qmd file below Room 3, or create a new file level3_palace_room4.qmd.\n\nWould you like Room 4 added now (detailed gallery with proofs/sketches and narrative), or do you want to review/edit the current Rooms 1–3 first?",
