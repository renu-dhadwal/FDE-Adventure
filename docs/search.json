    "text": "2.1 First Steps: Repeated Integration and the Cauchy Formula\nAnanya: Acharya, this place feels mysterious. What lies in this temple?\nAcharya Anvaya: This is the Temple of Smriti, or memory. It contains the secrets of memory, the key to which lies in the idea of the fractional integral.\nAnanya: Hmm… the integral is by itself a sort of memory, isn’t it? When we integrate a function from \\(0\\) to \\(t\\):\n\\[\nI^1 f(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} f(\\tau)\\, d\\tau\n\\]\nwe are collecting its entire past. This is a kind of memory, isn’t it?\nAcharya Anvaya: You are absolutely right, Ananya! But before the temple reveals its secret, let us recall what happens when we integrate repeatedly.\nQuestion: What is the integral of \\(1\\)?\nAnanya:\n\\[\nI^1(1)(t) = \\int_0^t 1\\, d\\tau = t.\n\\]\nAcharya Anvaya: Good. And integrating once more?\nAnanya:\n\\[\nI^2(1)(t) = \\int_0^t I^1(1)(\\tau)\\, d\\tau = \\int_0^t \\tau\\, d\\tau = \\frac{t^2}{2!}.\n\\]\nAcharya Anvaya: And once more?\nAnanya:\n\\[\nI^3(1)(t) = \\int_0^t I^2(1)(\\tau)\\, d\\tau = \\int_0^t \\frac{\\tau^2}{2}\\, d\\tau = \\frac{t^3}{3!}.\n\\]\nAcharya Anvaya: Yes! The \\(n\\)-th integral of a function \\(f(t)\\) can be written using the Cauchy formula for repeated integration:\n\\[\nI^n f(t) = \\frac{1}{(n-1)!}\\int_0^t (t-\\tau)^{\\,n-1} f(\\tau)\\, d\\tau.\n\\]",

    "text": "2.2 The Riemann–Liouville Integral\nThe temple wall shimmers again, and new verses appear, written in flowing Sanskrit:\n“यथा यथा संचितं स्मर्यते, तथा तथैव अनन्तं स्मृतिः — As memory gathers step by step, it stretches into infinity.”\nAcharya Anvaya: The formula you just derived for integer \\(n\\), Ananya, is not bound to whole numbers alone. The Great ones in modern times, Riemann from Germany and Liouville from France extended it further. This is known today as the Riemann–Liouville fractional integral:\n\\[\n(I^\\alpha f)(t) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\int_0^t (t-\\tau)^{\\alpha-1} f(\\tau)\\, d\\tau, \\qquad \\alpha &gt; 0.\n\\]\nAnanya: So it is the same as the Cauchy formula, but with \\((n-1)!\\) replaced by \\(\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\) — allowing \\(\\alpha\\) to be any positive real number?\nAcharya Anvaya: Exactly. This was the leap — from repeated integer steps to a smooth continuum of memory depths. Each value of \\(\\alpha\\) encodes how strongly the past is remembered.\nAcharya Anvaya: Just as the smriti texts preserve memory across centuries, a fractional integral preserves traces of all past values of a function. But the weight of remembrance fades, just as stories fade with time.\nAnanya: So the past influences the present, but the farther back in time we go, the weaker its pull?\nAcharya Anvaya: Precisely. Like the echo of a conch in the Himalayas — recent notes ring loud, but the first strike still whispers faintly.\n\n\n2.2.1 Mini-Quest 1: The Half-Memory\nEvaluate \\(I^{1/2}(1)\\).\nAnswer:\n\\[\n(I^{1/2}1)(t) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\, t^{1/2}.\n\\]\nAcharya Anvaya: Well done, Ananya. You have grasped the essence of fractional memory. You now hold the Key of Smriti (Memory). With it, the temple doors open to the next journey.\nThe fractional integral is like oral tradition: newer retellings weigh more, but the first telling is never fully erased.\nA smaller \\(\\alpha\\) preserves distant past more strongly — like stories handed down for centuries.\nA larger \\(\\alpha\\) emphasizes the near past — like yesterday’s lived experiences.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Mini-Quest 2: Comparing Memories\nWhich value of \\(\\alpha\\) remembers the distant past most strongly?\n\nChoice A: \\(\\alpha = 0.2\\)\n\nChoice B: \\(\\alpha = 0.5\\)\n\nChoice C: \\(\\alpha = 0.9\\)\n\nAnanya: Since the kernel is \\((t-\\tau)^{\\alpha - 1}\\), smaller \\(\\alpha\\) means slower decay. So the answer is A.\nAcharya Anvaya: Correct. You understand how the depth of memory depends on \\(\\alpha\\). The temple blesses you with wisdom for the journey ahead.\nAnanya: I am curious to know more about where such memory comes up.",

    "text": "2.3 Example: Stress–Strain in Viscoelastic Fluids\nAcharya Anvaya: Have you heard of Hooke’s law in solids?\nAnanya: Yes! It says:\n\\[\n\\sigma(t) = E \\, \\varepsilon(t).\n\\]\nThe stress responds instantly to strain.\nAcharya Anvaya: But how does this change for flowing materials?\nAnanya: From what I know, for purely viscous fluids, Newton’s law governs:\n\\[\n\\sigma(t) = \\eta \\, \\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt}(t).\n\\]\nAcharya Anvaya: Here stress depends only on the rate of strain at the present moment.\nAnanya: So both Hooke’s law and Newton’s law speak only of the present. They have no memory of what came before?\nAcharya Anvaya: Exactly. But the world of polymers is different. These are viscoelastic materials. Their stress at time \\(t\\) remembers the entire history of strain. It is written as:\n\\[\n\\sigma(t) = \\int_0^t G(t-\\tau)\\,\\frac{d\\varepsilon}{d\\tau}(\\tau)\\,d\\tau,\n\\]\nwhere \\(G\\) is the relaxation kernel — the weight of memory.\nAnanya: So the kernel is like the echoing chamber of the temple — weighing the voices of the past according to distance in time?\nAcharya Anvaya: Precisely. If \\(G\\) is exponential we get Maxwell-type models. Experiments often show a power-law:\n\\[\nG(t-\\tau)\\sim (t-\\tau)^{-\\alpha}, \\qquad 0&lt;\\alpha&lt;1.\n\\]\nAnanya: Then stress never completely forgets — the echoes fade slowly.\nAcharya Anvaya: Substituting this kernel gives a fractional constitutive law:\n\\[\n\\sigma(t)=\\eta_\\alpha\\,D_t^\\alpha\\varepsilon(t),\n\\]\nwhere \\(D_t^\\alpha\\) is a fractional derivative of the strain.\nAnanya: But what exactly is a fractional derivative?\nAcharya Anvaya: For guidance:\n\nFor \\(\\alpha = 1\\):\n\\[\nD_t^1 \\varepsilon(t) = \\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt}(t),\n\\]\nthe ordinary derivative, as in Newton’s law of viscosity.\nFor \\(\\alpha = 0\\):\n\\[\nD_t^0 \\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon(t),\n\\]\ni.e. the function itself, as in Hooke’s law of elasticity.\nFor \\(0&lt;\\alpha&lt;1\\):\n\\(D_t^\\alpha\\) interpolates smoothly between these two extremes, capturing behavior that is partly elastic and partly viscous (viscoelastic behavior).\n\nAnanya: So when \\(\\alpha=0\\), the memory is eternal — purely elastic. When \\(\\alpha=1\\), memory vanishes quickly — purely viscous. And for \\(0&lt;\\alpha&lt;1\\), we have viscoelasticity, with fading memory that bridges the two.\nAcharya Anvaya: Exactly! Thus, the language of fractional calculus is the scripture that describes memory in matter — echoing from the temple walls into the world of flowing polymers.\nAcharya Anvaya: We will learn about fractional derivatives as we go further to the Ganges — the River of Derivatives.\nNarrator: With the Key of Smriti in hand, Ananya steps through the temple gates. The path ahead leads to the River of Derivatives.",
