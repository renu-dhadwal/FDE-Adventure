    "text": "2.1 🔹 Bounds\nLila:\n“Acharya, we already have natural numbers, integers, rationals. Why do we need real numbers? Aren’t rationals enough?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“That is a wise question, Lila. Let us test the rationals. Can you think of a number whose square is 2?”\nLila:\n“Well… if I try,\n- \\[1.4^2 = 1.96\\],\n- \\[1.41^2 = 1.9881\\],\n- \\[1.414^2 = 1.999396\\]…\nWe get closer, but never exactly 2.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“So, do you think there is a rational number \\(q\\) with \\(q^2 = 2\\)?”\nLila:\n“No. I’ve seen the proof that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is irrational.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Correct. But notice this: even if \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is not rational, we can approximate it as closely as we like using rationals — 1.4, 1.41, 1.414… The rationals are dense: between any two rationals, there is another. Yet something is still missing.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Let us capture this rigorously. Consider the set\n\\[ S = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{Q} : x^2 &lt; 2 \\}. \\]\nIs there a number that is always greater than every element of this set?”\nLila:\n“Sure, 2 is bigger than all of them. So is 1.5, or 1.42.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Exactly. We call such numbers upper bounds. But among them, some are tighter than others. Which number feels like the ‘tightest’ upper bound?”\nLila:\n“It should be \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), since that’s where the set stops.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Indeed. But here is the problem: \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is not in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). So the rationals cannot capture the least upper bound of this set.”",

The rationals are dense but incomplete. The missing piece is the completeness property of the reals.”",
