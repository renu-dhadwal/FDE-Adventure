What lies in this temple? {.student}\nAcharya Anvaya: This is the Temple of Smriti, or memory. It contains the secrets of memory, the key to which lies in the idea of the fractional integral. {.teacher}\nAnanya: Hmm… the integral is by itself a sort of memory, isn’t it? When we integrate a function from 0 to t:\n\\[\nI^1 f(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} f(\\tau)\\, d\\tau\n\\]\nwe are collecting its entire past. This is a kind of memory, isn’t it? {.student}\nAcharya Anvaya: You are absolutely right, Ananya! But before the temple reveals its secret, let us recall what happens when we integrate repeatedly. {.teacher}\nQuestion: What is the integral of (1)?\nAnanya:\n\\[\nI^1 (1)(t) = \\int_0^t 1\\, d\\tau = t.\n\\] {.student}\nAcharya Anvaya: Good. And integrating once more? {.teacher}\nAnanya:\n\\[\nI^2 (1)(t) = \\int_0^t I^1(1)(\\tau)\\, d\\tau = \\int_0^t \\tau\\, d\\tau = \\frac{t^2}{2!}.\n\\] {.student}\nAcharya Anvaya: And once more? {.teacher}\nAnanya:\n\\[\nI^3 (1)(t) = \\int_0^t I^2(1)(\\tau)\\, d\\tau = \\int_0^t \\frac{\\tau^2}{2}\\, d\\tau = \\frac{t^3}{3!}.\n\\] {.student}\nAcharya Anvaya: Yes! The \\(n^{th}\\) integral of a function \\(f(x)\\) can be written using the Cauchy formula for repeated integration:\n\\[\nI^n f(t) = \\frac{1}{(n-1)!} \\int_0^t (t-\\tau)^{\\,n-1} f(\\tau)\\, d\\tau.\n\\] {.teacher}",
