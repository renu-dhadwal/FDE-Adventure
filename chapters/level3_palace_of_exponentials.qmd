This page mixes mythic scenes, dialogues (Pavni & Acharya), mathematics, runnable code, and student quests — all ready to drop into your Quarto project.

## Scene 1 — Entrance & lore

The palace gates open on a fresco of two names: **Mittag** and **Leffler**. A gentle wind seems to replay the earliest footsteps — not as an exponential fade but as a long remembered murmur. Pavni and Acharya stand beneath the arch.

```
Pavni: "Why does this place feel like it remembers everything?"
Acharya: "Because its laws are fractional — the halls do not forget the past at once. Here, the exponential is a resident, but the palace sings a deeper song."
```

<details>
<summary>Short classroom prompt</summary>

Ask students: "Compare the intuition behind exponential decay $e^{-t}$ and the Mittag–Leffler decay for $E_\alpha(-t^\alpha)$. What physical processes might each model better?"

</details>

## Scene 2 — Grand Hall: definitions & quick facts

The Grand Hall contains a carved plaque with the incantation.

$E_{\alpha,\beta}(z) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{z^k}{\Gamma(\alpha k + \beta)}, \qquad \alpha>0,\ \beta\in\mathbb C.$

The single-parameter function is $E_\alpha(z)=E_{\alpha,1}(z)$. A small doorway labeled $\alpha=1$ leads back to a chamber inscribed with $e^z$.

<details>
<summary>Properties & remarks</summary>

- Entire function: the series converges for all $z\in\mathbb C$.
- Special case: $E_{1,1}(z)=e^z$ because $\Gamma(k+1)=k!$.
- Memory: for $0<\alpha<1$ solutions often decay algebraically rather than exponentially, giving long tails.

## Scene 3 — Library of Laplace transforms (derivation)

They enter a quiet library where scrolls record transform pairs. Acharya unrolls a scroll.

```
Acharya: "Take the Caputo equation {}^{C}D_t^\alpha y = \lambda y,\quad y(0)=y_0, with 0<\alpha\le 1."
Pavni: "Laplace it — as if we seek the frequency-soul of the equation."
```

Using the Caputo Laplace identity,

$\mathcal L\{ {}^{C}D_t^\alpha y\}(s) = s^\alpha \tilde y(s) - s^{\alpha-1} y(0),$

we obtain

$s^\alpha \tilde y(s) - s^{\alpha-1} y_0 = \lambda \tilde y(s) \quad\Rightarrow\quad \tilde y(s) = \frac{s^{\alpha-1} y_0}{s^\alpha - \lambda}.$

Inverting with the standard Laplace pair (see below) yields

$y(t) = y_0 E_\alpha(\lambda t^\alpha).$

<details>
<summary>Laplace pair used (reminder)</summary>

For suitable $s$ and real $\beta$,

$\mathcal L\{ t^{\beta-1} E_{\alpha,\beta}(\pm \lambda t^\alpha)\}(s) = \frac{s^{\alpha-\beta}}{s^\alpha \mp \lambda}.$

Setting $\beta=1$ recovers the pair used in the derivation.

## Scene 4 — Mirror Room: asymptotics & intuition

The Mirror Room bends long reflections into slow tails. A descriptive dialogue helps students internalize asymptotics.

```
Pavni: "When alpha is small, why do echoes die so slowly?"
Acharya: "Because the Mittag–Leffler's coefficients, divided by Gamma(\alpha k+1), shift more mass to early terms and produce algebraic-like behaviour at long times — the memory stores the past."
```

<details>
<summary>Concise asymptotic note (for teacher)</summary>

For $0<\alpha<2$ and large $|z|$ away from certain sectorial rays, there are known asymptotic expansions of $E_{\alpha,\beta}(z)$. On the negative real axis, solutions like $E_\alpha(-t^\alpha)$ typically show slower decay than $e^{-t}$, often algebraic in nature; reference Mainardi (2000) for readable summaries.

## Scene 5 — Marble Hall: mini-quest (numerical verification)

The Marble Hall contains a bench where students can perform three trials.

**Mini-Quest**

1. Verify numerically that the Caputo ODE

${}^{C}D_t^\alpha y(t) = -y(t), \quad y(0)=1,$

has solution $y(t)=E_\alpha(-t^\alpha)$ for $\alpha=0.6$ on $[0,5]$.

2. Prove $E_1(z)=e^z$ by comparing series.

3. Bonus: estimate time $T$ where $E_{0.6}(-t^{0.6})<0.1$ and compare with exponential decay.

<details>
<summary>Starter hint (GL scheme)</summary>

Use the Grünwald–Letnikov approximation for the fractional derivative with step $\Delta t$:

${}^{C}D_t^\alpha y(t_n) \approx \frac{1}{(\Delta t)^\alpha} \sum_{k=0}^n w_k y_{n-k},$

where $w_k = (-1)^k \binom{\alpha}{k}$. March forward in time and compare to $E_\alpha(-t^\alpha)$ from `mpmath`.

## Scene 6 — Courtyard: dialogues, teacher notes & extensions

**Dialogue (Pavni & Acharya) — pedagogical tone**

```
Pavni: "So if I want to model slow relaxation in a polymer chain, should I always use Mittag–Leffler?"
Acharya: "Not always. Use it when experimental data show long tails and history-dependence that a single exponential can't capture. But check the physical derivation: sometimes distributed-order models, or multi-term fractional models, fit better."

Pavni: "How would I explain this to an undergraduate class?"
Acharya: "Say: exponentials forget quickly; Mittag–Leffler remembers longer. Show both plots side-by-side and ask them which curve fits the data better. Then introduce numerical schemes to compute the fractional derivative."
```

<details>
<summary>Teacher notes</summary>

- **Prerequisites**: Students should have seen power-series expansions and Laplace transforms (or you can provide a short recap). They should be comfortable with numerical ODE stepping.
- **Assessment ideas**: Implement GL scheme; compare to `mpmath` evaluation; write a short report interpreting the physical meaning of long tails in data.
- **Reading**: Podlubny (1999), Mainardi surveys.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Extensions</summary>

- Add complex-plane plots of $E_{\alpha,\beta}(z)$ showing sectorial asymptotics.
- Provide a student project: fit an experimental relaxation dataset with a fractional model using least-squares for $\alpha$ and a scale parameter.
- Discuss multi-term fractional ODEs and how superposition of Mittag–Leffler terms can model multi-exponential-like behaviour.
