# Palace of Eternal Exponentials — Rooms 1–3

This file contains the first three rooms of the Palace of Eternal Exponentials:
1. The Gates of Exponentials  
2. The Hall of Fractional Derivatives  
3. The Chamber of Generalisation

Each room uses a short dialogue between **Ananya** and **Acharya Anvay** and short mathematical plaques that students can study.

---

## Room 1 — The Gates of Exponentials

The gates of the palace are tall and bright, inscribed with countless copies of the familiar function \(e^t\). Ananya and Acharya Anvay pause at the threshold.

**Ananya:** "This part feels familiar. The exponential is everywhere. But why does it appear so naturally in differential equations?"  

**Acharya Anvay:** "Because the exponential is the eigenfunction of the derivative operator. Let’s recall the simplest case."

A golden plaque reads:

\[
y'(t) = \lambda y(t), \qquad y(0)=y_0.
\]

**Two standard derivations**

- **Separation of variables.**  
  \[
  \frac{dy}{y}=\lambda dt \quad\Rightarrow\quad y(t)=y_0 e^{\lambda t}.
  \]

- **Laplace transform.**  
  \[
  \mathcal L\{y'(t)\}(s)=s\tilde y(s)-y_0.
  \]
  So
  \[
  s\tilde y(s)-y_0=\lambda \tilde y(s)\quad\Rightarrow\quad \tilde y(s)=\frac{y_0}{s-\lambda},
  \]
  and inversion yields \(y(t)=y_0 e^{\lambda t}\).

**Ananya:** "So \(e^{\lambda t}\) repeats itself under differentiation — that’s why it rules this gate."  

**Acharya Anvay:** "Exactly. Exponential is the natural solution whenever we deal with first-order derivatives. But the palace has deeper chambers. What if the derivative is *fractional*? What will replace the exponential then?"

The gates open with this question, inviting them into the Hall of Fractional Derivatives.

---

## Room 2 — The Hall of Fractional Derivatives

As the gates close behind them, Ananya and Acharya Anvay enter a high-ceilinged hall. Strange symbols line the marble walls — integrals stretching into the past, and powers of \(s\) rising into the ceiling. At the centre is a pedestal with a single formula glowing.

**Ananya:** "This isn’t the derivative I know. The inscription looks like the Laplace transform, but something’s different."

**Acharya Anvay:** "Yes. This is the Caputo fractional derivative. Remember, the Laplace transform itself is unchanged:
\[
\mathcal L\{f(t)\}(s) = \int_0^\infty e^{-st} f(t)\,dt.
\]
But when we apply it to a fractional derivative, the transform rule changes."

The pedestal shows the key identity for the Caputo derivative (for \(0<\alpha\le 1\)):

\[
\mathcal L\{{}^C D_t^\alpha f(t)\}(s) \;=\; s^\alpha \tilde f(s) - s^{\alpha-1} f(0).
\]

**Ananya:** "So instead of \(s\tilde f(s)-f(0)\) we now get \(s^\alpha\tilde f(s)-s^{\alpha-1}f(0)\)?"  

**Acharya Anvay:** "Exactly. That single change — the appearance of \(s^\alpha\) — is what transforms the entire palace. It means fractional derivatives take us from linear powers of \(s\) to fractional ones."

They step to a carved arch showing the fractional analogue of the exponential ODE:

\[
{}^C D_t^\alpha y(t) = \lambda y(t), \qquad y(0)=y_0.
\]

Applying the Laplace identity gives the stone inscription:

\[
s^\alpha \tilde y(s) - s^{\alpha-1} y_0 = \lambda \tilde y(s)
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\tilde y(s) = \frac{s^{\alpha-1} y_0}{s^\alpha - \lambda}.
\]

**Ananya:** "The denominator is \(s^\alpha-\lambda\), not \(s-\lambda\). The shape of the solution must be completely different!"  

**Acharya Anvay:** "In the next room you will meet the function that inverts this transform — the true master of this palace: the Mittag–Leffler function."

---

## Room 3 — The Chamber of Generalisation

They step into a circular chamber lit by soft blue light. The floor is inlaid with spirals of numbers, and at the centre stands a tall column. Upon it glows a new formula — one Ananya has never seen before.

**Ananya:** "This looks like a series… but the denominator has \(\Gamma\) functions!"

On the column is written the defining series:

\[
E_{\alpha,\beta}(z) \;=\; \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{z^k}{\Gamma(\alpha k + \beta)},
\qquad \alpha>0,\ \beta\in\mathbb C,
\]

and the single-parameter form

\[
E_\alpha(z):=E_{\alpha,1}(z).
\]

**Acharya Anvay:** "This is the **Mittag–Leffler function**. It is the natural generalisation of the exponential."

**Ananya:** "If I take \(\alpha=1, \beta=1\) I get
\[
E_{1,1}(z)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{z^k}{\Gamma(k+1)}=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{z^k}{k!}=e^z.
\]
So the exponential is a special doorway inside this chamber!"

The surrounding walls light up with short plaques:

- **Convergence / entireness:** the series converges for all \(z\in\mathbb C\); \(E_{\alpha,\beta}\) is entire.  
- **Value at zero:** \(E_\alpha(0)=1\).  
- **Operational identity (Laplace):**
  \[
  \mathcal L\{ E_\alpha(\lambda t^\alpha)\}(s) = \frac{s^{\alpha-1}}{s^\alpha-\lambda},
  \]
  which exactly inverts the transform found in Room 2.

**Ananya:** "So \(E_\alpha\) is exactly the inverse Laplace transform of the expression from the Hall of Fractional Derivatives."  

**Acharya Anvay:** "Yes. It is the eigenfunction of the fractional derivative in the same way the exponential is the eigenfunction of the ordinary derivative."

They stand quietly, absorbing the fact that what looked like a small change in the differentiation rule leads to an entire new landscape of functions.

### Navigation note
- Next: **Room 4 — The Gallery of Properties** (asymptotics, growth, spectral representation, monotonicity).  
- If you want, I can place Room 4 into the same `.qmd` file below Room 3, or create a new file `level3_palace_room4.qmd`.  

Would you like Room 4 added now (detailed gallery with proofs/sketches and narrative), or do you want to review/edit the current Rooms 1–3 first?
