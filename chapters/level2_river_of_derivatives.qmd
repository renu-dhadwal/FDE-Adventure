### Scene: Arrival at the River

With the Key of Smriti in hand, Ananya steps beyond the temple gates. A wide river flows before her, restless and shining. On the shore rest **two boats**, each with a carved name: *Riemann–Liouville* and *Caputo*.

**Ananya**: Two boats? Which one do we take to cross the River of Derivatives?

**Acharya Anvaya**: Both will carry you across, but their way of remembering the river differs. One remembers everything since the river’s source; the other begins its memory only when you step aboard.

---

## Rigorous Definitions

**Acharya Anvaya**: Let us be precise. Suppose $n-1 < \alpha \leq n$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

- **Riemann–Liouville fractional derivative**:

$$
D_t^\alpha f(t) \;=\; \frac{d^n}{dt^n}\, I^{\,n-\alpha} f(t)
\;=\; \frac{1}{\Gamma(n-\alpha)}\frac{d^n}{dt^n}\int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\,n-\alpha-1} f(\tau)\,d\tau.
$$

- **Caputo fractional derivative**:

$$
{}^C D_t^\alpha f(t) \;=\;
I^{\,n-\alpha} f^{(n)}(t)
\;=\;\frac{1}{\Gamma(n-\alpha)}\int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\,n-\alpha-1} f^{(n)}(\tau)\,d\tau.
$$

**Ananya**: So the difference is: Riemann–Liouville differentiates *after* integrating, while Caputo differentiates *before* integrating?

**Acharya Anvaya**: Exactly. Two boats across the same river — same waters, different journeys.

## Worked Example: Power Functions

**Acharya Anvaya**: For the Riemann–Liouville derivative of $t^\beta$ ($\beta > -1$):

$$
D_t^\alpha \, t^\beta = \frac{\Gamma(\beta+1)}{\Gamma(\beta-\alpha+1)} \, t^{\beta-\alpha}.
$$

**Ananya**: So the power drops by $\alpha$, and the Gamma function adjusts the scale.

**Acharya Anvaya**: Correct. For example, with $\alpha = \tfrac{1}{2}$ and $f(t)=t^2$:

$$
D_t^{1/2}\, t^2 = \frac{\Gamma(3)}{\Gamma(2.5)} \, t^{3/2}.
$$

---

## Worked Example: Caputo Derivative of Power Functions

**Acharya Anvaya**: For the Caputo derivative, recall:

$$
{}^C D_t^\alpha f(t) =
\frac{1}{\Gamma(n-\alpha)}\int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\,n-\alpha-1} f^{(n)}(\tau)\, d\tau.
$$

- If $f(t) = t^\beta$ with $\beta \leq n-1$, then ${}^C D_t^\alpha f(t) = 0$.  
- If $\beta > n-1$, then

$$
{}^C D_t^\alpha t^\beta
= \frac{\Gamma(\beta+1)}{\Gamma(\beta-\alpha+1)}\, t^{\beta-\alpha}.
$$

So for most powers, Riemann–Liouville and Caputo agree, but for low-degree polynomials, Caputo derivatives vanish.

### Mini-Quest: Compare RL and Caputo

**Task**: Compute the Riemann–Liouville and Caputo derivatives of $f(t)=t^2$ for $\alpha = \tfrac12$.

- **Riemann–Liouville**:

$$
D_t^{1/2} t^2 = \frac{\Gamma(3)}{\Gamma(2.5)}\, t^{3/2}.
$$

- **Caputo**:

$$
{}^C D_t^{1/2} t^2 = \frac{\Gamma(3)}{\Gamma(2.5)}\, t^{3/2}.
$$

**Observation**: For this function, both definitions give the same result.

**Acharya Anvaya**: But remember — for low-degree polynomials or problems with initial data, the two boats may diverge.

---

## Worked Example: Exponentials

**Acharya Anvaya**: For exponentials, both boats sing the same melody:

$$
D_t^\alpha e^{\lambda t} \;=\; {}^C D_t^\alpha e^{\lambda t} \;=\; \lambda^\alpha e^{\lambda t}.
$$

**Ananya**: Beautiful! The exponential remains its own shape, and $\lambda$ is lifted to a fractional power.

**Acharya Anvaya**: Exactly. Exponentials are the eigenfunctions of fractional derivatives.

### Scene: Choosing a Boat

**Ananya**: I think I prefer the Caputo boat for practical problems — the initial data are familiar.

**Acharya Anvaya**: A wise choice for modeling. Yet the Riemann–Liouville boat is elegant in theory. Both are needed, depending on where the river carries us.

### Narrator

**Narrator**: The two boats set out across the River of Derivatives, their oars dipping into currents of change. On the far shore rises the **Forest of Equations**, where whole systems await — fractional differential equations that weave memory and change into one.
