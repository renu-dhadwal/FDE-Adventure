### Scene: Arrival at the River

With the Key of Smriti in hand, Ananya steps beyond the temple gates. A wide river flows before her, restless and shining. On the shore rest **two boats**, each with a carved name: *Riemann–Liouville* and *Caputo*.

**Ananya**: Two boats? Which one do we take to cross the River of Derivatives?

**Acharya Anvaya**: Both will carry you across, but their way of remembering the river differs. One remembers everything since the river’s source; the other begins its memory only when you step aboard.

## Rigorous Definitions

**Acharya Anvaya**: Let us be precise. Suppose $n-1 < \alpha \leq n$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

- **Riemann–Liouville fractional derivative**:

$$
D_t^\alpha f(t) \;=\; \frac{d^n}{dt^n}\, I^{\,n-\alpha} f(t)
\;=\; \frac{1}{\Gamma(n-\alpha)}\frac{d^n}{dt^n}\int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\,n-\alpha-1} f(\tau)\,d\tau.
$$

- **Caputo fractional derivative**:

$$
{}^C D_t^\alpha f(t) \;=\;
I^{\,n-\alpha} f^{(n)}(t)
\;=\;\frac{1}{\Gamma(n-\alpha)}\int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\,n-\alpha-1} f^{(n)}(\tau)\,d\tau.
$$

**Ananya**: So the difference is: Riemann–Liouville differentiates *after* integrating, while Caputo differentiates *before* integrating?

**Acharya Anvaya**: Exactly. Two boats across the same river — same waters, different journeys.

## Comparison at a Glance

| Aspect             | Riemann–Liouville                          | Caputo                                |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Formula            | $D^\alpha f = \dfrac{d^n}{dt^n} I^{n-\alpha} f$ | ${}^C D^\alpha f = I^{n-\alpha} f^{(n)}$ |
| Memory starts      | From $t=0$ (full history)                  | From problem start (with $f^{(n)}$)   |
| Initial conditions | Involve fractional integrals               | Classical: $f(0), f'(0), \dots$       |
| Common use         | Pure math / theory                        | Physics / engineering                 |

## Worked Example: Power Functions

**Ananya**: Can we compute something concrete?

**Acharya Anvaya**: Yes. For the Riemann–Liouville derivative of $t^\beta$ ($\beta > -1$):

$$
D_t^\alpha \, t^\beta = \frac{\Gamma(\beta+1)}{\Gamma(\beta-\alpha+1)} \, t^{\beta-\alpha}.
$$

**Ananya**: So the power drops by $\alpha$, and the Gamma function adjusts the scale.

**Acharya Anvaya**: Correct. For example, with $\alpha = \tfrac{1}{2}$ and $f(t)=t^2$:

$$
D_t^{1/2}\, t^2 = \frac{\Gamma(3)}{\Gamma(2.5)} \, t^{1.5}.
$$

## Worked Example: Exponential Functions

**Acharya Anvaya**: For the exponential, something elegant happens:

$$
D_t^\alpha e^{\lambda t} = \lambda^\alpha e^{\lambda t}.
$$

**Ananya**: Just as the ordinary derivative gives $\lambda e^{\lambda t}$, now the order $\alpha$ raises $\lambda$ to a fractional power?

**Acharya Anvaya**: Exactly. This is why exponentials are the “eigenfunctions” of fractional derivatives.

### Mini-Quest: Elastic, Viscous, Viscoelastic

Match each $\alpha$ to the behavior:

1. $\alpha = 0$  
2. $\alpha = 1$  
3. $0<\alpha<1$

Choices: purely elastic / purely viscous / viscoelastic (fading memory)

**Answer**:  
- $\alpha = 0$: purely elastic  
- $\alpha = 1$: purely viscous  
- $0<\alpha<1$: viscoelastic

### Scene: Choosing a Boat

**Ananya**: I think I prefer the Caputo boat for practical problems — the initial data are familiar.

**Acharya Anvaya**: A wise choice for modeling. Yet the Riemann–Liouville boat is elegant in theory. Both are needed, depending on where the river carries us.

### Narrator

**Narrator**: The two boats set out across the River of Derivatives, their oars dipping into currents of change. On the far shore rises the **Forest of Equations**, where whole systems await — fractional differential equations that weave memory and change into one.
