### Scene: Arrival at the River

With the Key of Smriti in hand, Ananya steps beyond the temple gates. Before her flows a wide river, its surface broken by currents and eddies — the **River of Derivatives**. On the shore rest **two boats**, each with a carved name: **Riemann–Liouville** and **Caputo**.

**Ananya**: Two boats? Which one do we take to cross the River of Derivatives?

**Acharya Anvaya**: Both will carry you across, but their way of remembering the river differs. One remembers everything since the river’s source; the other begins its memory the moment you step aboard.

---

## The Two Boats: Intuition

**Acharya Anvaya**: Think of the river as change itself. A derivative measures how a quantity changes; a fractional derivative measures change while remembering the past. The two boats are two mathematical realizations of that remembering.

- The **Riemann–Liouville boat** carries memory that reaches back to the origin of time $0$.  
- The **Caputo boat** begins its memory from when you start the problem: it uses ordinary derivatives first, then distributes memory.

## Definitions (the plaques on the boats)

<div class="boat-box">

**Riemann–Liouville derivative (plaque on the first boat)**  

For $n-1 < \alpha \leq n$,

$$
D_t^\alpha f(t) \;=\; \frac{d^n}{dt^n}\, I^{\,n-\alpha} f(t)
\;=\; \frac{d^n}{dt^n}\left(\frac{1}{\Gamma(n-\alpha)}\int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\,n-\alpha-1} f(\tau)\,d\tau\right).
$$

It first forms a fractional integral (remembering far into the past) and then differentiates $n$ times.

</div>

<div class="boat-box">

**Caputo derivative (plaque on the second boat)**  

For $n-1 < \alpha \leq n$,

$$
{}^C D_t^\alpha f(t) \;=\;
\frac{1}{\Gamma(n-\alpha)}\int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\,n-\alpha-1} f^{(n)}(\tau)\,d\tau.
$$

It differentiates first (ordinary derivatives), then applies a memory kernel — which makes initial conditions appear in the usual physical form.

## Mini-Quest 1: Which boat for modelling?

Consider a physical oscillator with standard initial displacement and velocity given at $t=0$. Which derivative definition is **usually more convenient** for setting initial conditions in the classical way?

- (A) Riemann–Liouville  
- (B) Caputo

**Answer**: (B) Caputo — because its formulation lets you impose initial conditions expressed in terms of integer-order derivatives (displacement, velocity, ...).

## Example: Exponential function (a shared melody)

**Ananya**: If $f(t)=e^{\lambda t}$, what do the fractional derivatives give?

**Acharya Anvaya**: For both definitions (in many standard settings) the operator acts like a fractional power on the eigenvalue:

$$
D_t^\alpha e^{\lambda t} = \lambda^\alpha e^{\lambda t}.
$$

This shows how fractional differentiation generalizes ordinary change: the exponential keeps its form while the “rate” $\lambda$ is raised to the fractional power.

## Mini-Quest 2: Physical interpretations

Match each $\alpha$ to the behaviour:

1. $\alpha = 0$  
2. $\alpha = 1$  
3. $0<\alpha<1$

Choices: purely elastic / purely viscous / viscoelastic (fading memory)

**Answer**: 1 → purely elastic, 2 → purely viscous, 3 → viscoelastic.

### Scene: Choosing a Boat

**Ananya**: I think I prefer the Caputo boat for practical problems — the initial data are familiar.

**Acharya Anvaya**: A wise choice when modeling experiments. Yet the Riemann–Liouville boat is elegant and powerful for some theoretical developments. Both are paths across the same river.

---

### Narrator

**Narrator**: Ananya climbs into the Caputo boat; Acharya steadies the Riemann–Liouville. Both glide over the River of Derivatives. On the far bank rises the **Forest of Equations**, where fractional differential equations will test their new knowledge.
