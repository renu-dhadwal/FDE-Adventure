### Scene: Arrival at the River

With the Key of Smriti in hand, Ananya steps beyond the temple gates. A wide river flows before her, restless and shining. On the shore rest **two boats**, each with a carved name: *Riemann–Liouville* and *Caputo*.

**Ananya**: Two boats? Which one do we take to cross the River of Derivatives?

**Acharya Anvaya**: Both will carry you across, but their way of remembering the river differs. One remembers everything since the river’s source; the other begins its memory only when you step aboard.

---

## Rigorous Definitions

**Acharya Anvaya**: Let us be precise. Suppose $n-1 < \alpha \leq n$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

- **Riemann–Liouville fractional derivative**:

$$
D_t^\alpha f(t) \;=\; \frac{d^n}{dt^n}\, I^{\,n-\alpha} f(t)
\;=\; \frac{1}{\Gamma(n-\alpha)}\frac{d^n}{dt^n}\int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\,n-\alpha-1} f(\tau)\,d\tau.
$$

- **Caputo fractional derivative**:

$$
{}^C D_t^\alpha f(t) \;=\;
I^{\,n-\alpha} f^{(n)}(t)
\;=\;\frac{1}{\Gamma(n-\alpha)}\int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\,n-\alpha-1} f^{(n)}(\tau)\,d\tau.
$$

**Ananya**: So the difference is: Riemann–Liouville differentiates *after* integrating, while Caputo differentiates *before* integrating?

**Acharya Anvaya**: Exactly. Two boats across the same river — same waters, different journeys.

## Worked Example: Power Functions

**Ananya**: Can we compute something concrete?

**Acharya Anvaya**: Yes. For the Riemann–Liouville derivative of $t^\beta$ ($\beta > -1$):

$$
D_t^\alpha \, t^\beta = \frac{\Gamma(\beta+1)}{\Gamma(\beta-\alpha+1)} \, t^{\beta-\alpha}.
$$

**Ananya**: So the power drops by $\alpha$, and the Gamma function adjusts the scale.

**Acharya Anvaya**: Correct. For example, with $\alpha = \tfrac{1}{2}$ and $f(t)=t^2$:

$$
D_t^{1/2}\, t^2 = \frac{\Gamma(3)}{\Gamma(2.5)} \, t^{1.5}.
$$

---

## Worked Example: Exponential Functions

**Acharya Anvaya**: For the exponential, something elegant happens:

$$
D_t^\alpha e^{\lambda t} = \lambda^\alpha e^{\lambda t}.
$$

**Ananya**: Just as the ordinary derivative gives $\lambda e^{\lambda t}$, now the order $\alpha$ raises $\lambda$ to a fractional power?

**Acharya Anvaya**: Exactly. This is why exponentials are the “eigenfunctions” of fractional derivatives.

---
## Example: computing the Caputo derivative

Recall the Caputo derivative (for \(n-1<\alpha\le n\)):

$$
{}^C D_t^\alpha f(t)
= \frac{1}{\Gamma(n-\alpha)}\int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\,n-\alpha-1} f^{(n)}(\tau)\,d\tau.
$$

### Caputo derivative of a power \(t^\beta\)

Let \(f(t)=t^\beta\) with \(\beta>-1\). Compute \({}^C D_t^\alpha t^\beta\).
If \(\beta\) is a nonnegative integer with \(\beta\le n-1\), then \(f^{(n)}\equiv0\) and

$$
{}^C D_t^\alpha t^\beta = 0 \qquad (\beta =0,1,\dots,n-1).
$$

If \(\beta > n-1\), differentiate inside the integral and evaluate with the Beta function:

\[
\begin{aligned}
{}^C D_t^\alpha t^\beta
&= \frac{1}{\Gamma(n-\alpha)}\int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\,n-\alpha-1} \frac{d^n}{d\tau^n}\tau^\beta\, d\tau \\
&= \frac{\Gamma(\beta+1)}{\Gamma(\beta-n+1)\,\Gamma(n-\alpha)}
  \int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\,n-\alpha-1}\tau^{\beta-n}\, d\tau.
\end{aligned}
\]

Use the substitution \(\tau = t u\) and the Beta integral
\(\displaystyle \int_0^1 u^{p-1}(1-u)^{q-1}\,du = B(p,q)=\frac{\Gamma(p)\Gamma(q)}{\Gamma(p+q)}\).
This yields

$$
{}^C D_t^\alpha t^\beta
= \frac{\Gamma(\beta+1)}{\Gamma(\beta-\alpha+1)}\, t^{\beta-\alpha}.
$$

So — for \(\beta > n-1\) — the Caputo derivative of a power has the same closed form as the Riemann–Liouville derivative:

$$
{}^C D_t^\alpha t^\beta
= \frac{\Gamma(\beta+1)}{\Gamma(\beta-\alpha+1)}\, t^{\beta-\alpha}.
$$

---

### Concrete example: \(\alpha=\tfrac{1}{2}\), \(f(t)=t^2\)

Here \(n=1\) (because \(0<\tfrac12\le1\)) and \(\beta=2>n-1=0\). Apply the formula:

$$
{}^C D_t^{1/2} t^2
= \frac{\Gamma(3)}{\Gamma(3-\tfrac12)}\, t^{2-\tfrac12}
= \frac{\Gamma(3)}{\Gamma(2.5)}\, t^{3/2}.
$$

(You can rewrite the Gamma values if you like: \(\Gamma(3)=2\), \(\Gamma(2.5)=\tfrac{3}{4}\sqrt{\pi}\), so the constant equals \(2/(\tfrac{3}{4}\sqrt{\pi})=\tfrac{8}{3\sqrt{\pi}}\).)

---

### Caputo derivative of the exponential

For sufficiently regular (analytic) functions such as \(f(t)=e^{\lambda t}\), one obtains the familiar eigenfunction property:

$$
{}^C D_t^\alpha e^{\lambda t} \;=\; \lambda^\alpha e^{\lambda t},
$$

under the usual conventions (this holds when the fractional operator acts on the entire causal exponential; small caveats about branches of \(\lambda^\alpha\) apply if \(\lambda\) is complex).

---

### Remarks (practical takeaways)

- **Low-degree polynomials:** Caputo derivatives of polynomials of degree \(<n\) vanish — this is why Caputo is convenient for initial-value problems: classical initial data \(f(0),f'(0),\dots\) enter naturally.  
- **Matching with RL:** For sufficiently smooth powers (or analytic functions) the Caputo and Riemann–Liouville formulas often coincide (they produce the same closed form); the *difference* is mainly in how initial conditions are represented.  
- **Interpretation:** The factor \(t^{\beta-\alpha}\) shows the fractional derivative reduces the power by \(\alpha\) and rescales by Gamma factors — a precise interpolation between integer-order calculus results.


### Mini-Quest: Elastic, Viscous, Viscoelastic

Match each $\alpha$ to the behavior:

1. $\alpha = 0$  
2. $\alpha = 1$  
3. $0<\alpha<1$

Choices: purely elastic / purely viscous / viscoelastic (fading memory)

**Answer**:  
- $\alpha = 0$: purely elastic  
- $\alpha = 1$: purely viscous  
- $0<\alpha<1$: viscoelastic

### Scene: Choosing a Boat

**Ananya**: I think I prefer the Caputo boat for practical problems — the initial data are familiar.

**Acharya Anvaya**: A wise choice for modeling. Yet the Riemann–Liouville boat is elegant in theory. Both are needed, depending on where the river carries us.

---

### Narrator

**Narrator**: The two boats set out across the River of Derivatives, their oars dipping into currents of change. On the far shore rises the **Forest of Equations**, where whole systems await — fractional differential equations that weave memory and change into one.
