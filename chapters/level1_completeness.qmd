# 📖 Dialogue: Why Real Numbers?

---

**Lila**:  
“Acharya, we already have natural numbers, integers, rationals. Why do we need *real* numbers? Aren’t rationals enough?”  

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“That is a wise question, Lila. Let us test the rationals. Can you think of a number whose square is 2?”  

**Lila**:  
“Well… if I try,  
- $$1.4^2 = 1.96$$,  
- $$1.41^2 = 1.9881$$,  
- $$1.414^2 = 1.999396$$…  

We get closer, but never exactly 2.”  

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“So, do you think there is a rational number $$q$$ with $$q^2 = 2$$?”  

**Lila**:  
“No. I’ve seen the proof that $$\sqrt{2}$$ is irrational.”  

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Correct. But notice this: even if $$\sqrt{2}$$ is not rational, we can approximate it as closely as we like using rationals — 1.4, 1.41, 1.414… The rationals are dense: between any two rationals, there is another. Yet something is still missing.”

## 🔹 Bounds

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Let us capture this rigorously. Consider the set  

$$ S = \{ x \in \mathbb{Q} : x^2 < 2 \}. $$  

Is there a number that is always greater than every element of this set?”  

**Lila**:  
“Sure, 2 is bigger than all of them. So is 1.5, or 1.42.”  

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Exactly. We call such numbers *upper bounds*. But among them, some are tighter than others. Which number feels like the ‘tightest’ upper bound?”  

**Lila**:  
“It should be $$\sqrt{2}$$, since that’s where the set stops.”  

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Indeed. But here is the problem: $$\sqrt{2}$$ is not in $$\mathbb{Q}$$. So the rationals cannot capture the least upper bound of this set.”

## 🔹 Supremum

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“This brings us to a definition:  

- An **upper bound** of a set $$A \subset \mathbb{R}$$ is a number $$M$$ such that $$x \leq M$$ for all $$x \in A$$.  
- The **least upper bound** (also called the *supremum*) is the smallest such $$M$$, if it exists.”  

**Lila**:  
“So the problem with rationals is that some sets don’t have a supremum inside them?”  

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Precisely. The rationals are dense but incomplete. The missing piece is the *completeness property* of the reals.”  

---

## 🔹 Completeness Axiom

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“The defining property of the real numbers is this:  

> **Completeness Axiom**: Every nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a least upper bound (supremum) in $$\mathbb{R}$$.  

This axiom is what makes the real line whole.”  

---

## 🔹 Returning to $$S$$

**Lila**:  
“So for $$S = \{ x : x^2 < 2 \}$$, the supremum is $$\sqrt{2}$$, which *does* exist in $$\mathbb{R}$$.”  

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Exactly. And that, Lila, is the difference between rationals and reals. Completeness fills the gaps and makes the real line continuous. Without it, calculus itself would crumble.”
