**Scene**: Ananya and Acharya Anvaya stand before the **Temple of Smriti (Memory)**. Its walls glow faintly with carved verses. Above the arch is inscribed:  

*"कालः स्मृतिर्नित्यं — Kālaḥ Smṛtir Nityaṁ (Time is eternal memory)."*

## Part I – First Steps: Repeated Integration

**Acharya Anvaya**: Ananya, before the temple reveals its secret, let us recall what happens when we integrate repeatedly.

**Question**: What is the integral of $1$?

**Ananya**:

$$
I^1 (1)(t) = \int_0^t 1\, d\tau = t.
$$

**Acharya Anvaya**: Good. And integrating once more?

**Ananya**:

$$
I^2 (1)(t) = \int_0^t I^1(1)(\tau)\, d\tau = \int_0^t \tau\, d\tau = \frac{t^2}{2!}.
$$

## Part II – The Cauchy Formula

**Acharya Anvaya**: This can be written using the *Cauchy formula for repeated integration*:

$$
I^n f(t) = \frac{1}{(n-1)!} \int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\,n-1} f(\tau)\, d\tau.
$$

## Part III – The Bridge of Gamma

**Acharya Anvaya**: Replace factorials by the Gamma function to continue to fractional orders:

$$
(I^\alpha f)(t) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\alpha-1} f(\tau)\, d\tau.
$$

### Mini-Quest: The Half-Memory

Evaluate $(I^{1/2} 1)(t)$. The answer is

$$
(I^{1/2} 1)(t) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} t^{1/2}.
$$
