### Scene: Arrival at the Temple

Ananya and Acharya Anvaya stand before the **Temple of Smriti (Memory)**. Its walls glow faintly with fading carved Sanskrit verses. Above the arch is inscribed:  

*"कालः स्मृतिर्नित्यं — Kālaḥ Smṛtir Nityaṁ (Time is eternal memory)."*

## First Steps: Repeated Integration and the Cauchy Formula

**Ananya**: Acharya, this place feels mysterious. What lies in this temple?

**Acharya Anvaya**: This is the Temple of Smriti, or memory. It contains the secrets of memory, the key to which lies in the idea of the *fractional integral*.

**Ananya**: Hmm… the integral is by itself a sort of memory, isn’t it? When we integrate a function from 0 to t:  

$$
I^1 f(t) = \int_{0}^{t} f(\tau)\, d\tau
$$

we are collecting its entire past. This is a kind of memory, isn’t it?

**Acharya Anvaya**: You are absolutely right, Ananya! But before the temple reveals its secret, let us recall what happens when we integrate repeatedly.

**Question**: What is the integral of \(1\)?  

**Ananya**:  

$$
I^1 (1)(t) = \int_0^t 1\, d\tau = t.
$$ 

**Acharya Anvaya**: Good. And integrating once more?
 

**Ananya**:  

$$
I^2 (1)(t) = \int_0^t I^1(1)(\tau)\, d\tau = \int_0^t \tau\, d\tau = \frac{t^2}{2!}.
$$

**Acharya Anvaya**: And once more?

**Ananya**:  

$$
I^3 (1)(t) = \int_0^t I^2(1)(\tau)\, d\tau = \int_0^t \frac{\tau^2}{2}\, d\tau = \frac{t^3}{3!}.
$$

**Acharya Anvaya**: Yes! The $n^{th}$ integral of a function $f(x)$ can be written using the *Cauchy formula for repeated integration*:  
$$
I^n f(t) = \frac{1}{(n-1)!} \int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\,n-1} f(\tau)\, d\tau.
$$

## Memory in the Fractional Integral

**Acharya Anvaya**: Just as the *smriti* texts preserve memory across centuries, a fractional integral preserves traces of all past values of a function. But the weight of remembrance fades, just as stories fade with time.


The wall glows and reveals:  

$$
(I^\alpha f)(t) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\alpha-1} f(\tau)\, d\tau.
$$

**Acharya Anvaya**: We just replace factorials by the Gamma function to continue to fractional orders.

**Ananya**: So the past influences the present, but the farther back in time we go, the weaker its pull?
**Acharya Anvaya**: Precisely. Like the echo of a conch in the Himalayas — recent notes ring loud, but the first strike still whispers faintly.

## Mini-Quest 1: The Half-Memory

Evaluate $$I^{1/2} (1)$$.  

**Answer**:  

$$
(I^{1/2} 1)(t) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\, t^{1/2}.
$$

**Acharya Anvaya**: Well done, Ananya. You have grasped the essence of fractional memory. You now hold the **Key of Smriti (Memory)**. With it, the temple doors open to the next journey.
The fractional integral is like oral tradition: newer retellings weigh more, but the first telling is never fully erased.
A smaller $\alpha$ preserves distant past more strongly — like stories handed down for centuries. 
A larger $\alpha$ emphasizes the near past — like yesterday’s lived experiences.

## Mini-Quest 2: Comparing Memories

Which value of \(\alpha\) remembers the distant past most strongly?  

\begin{itemize}
  \item Choice A: \(\alpha = 0.2\)  
  \item Choice B: \(\alpha = 0.5\)  
  \item Choice C: \(\alpha = 0.9\)  
\end{itemize}

**Ananya**: Since the kernel is \((t-\tau)^{\alpha - 1}\), smaller \(\alpha\) means slower decay. So the answer is A.

**Acharya Anvaya**: Correct. You understand how the depth of memory depends on \(\alpha\). The temple blesses you with wisdom for the journey ahead.
**Ananya**: I am curious to know more about where such memory comes up.
## Dialogue: Stress–Strain in Viscoelastic Fluids

**Acharya Anvaya**:Have you heard of the *Hooke’s law* in solids?
** Ananya** : Yes! It says:  
$$
\sigma(t) = E \, \varepsilon(t).
$$  
The stress responds instantly to strain.

**Acharya Anyaya**:  But how does this change for flowing materials?

**Ananya**: from what I know, for purely viscous fluids, *Newton’s law* governs:  
$$
\sigma(t) = \eta \, \frac{d\varepsilon}{dt}(t).
$$  

**Acharya Anvaya**: Here stress depends only on the *rate* of strain at the present moment.

**Ananya**: So both Hooke’s law and Newton’s law speak only of the *present*. They have no memory of what came before?

**Acharya Anvaya**: Exactly. But the world of polymers is different. These are viscoelastic materials. Their stress at time $t$ remembers the *entire history of strain*. It is written as:  
$$
\sigma(t) = \int_0^t G(t-\tau)\,\frac{d\varepsilon}{d\tau}(\tau)\,d\tau,
$$
where $G$ is the **relaxation kernel** — the weight of memory.

**Ananya**: So the kernel is like the echoing chamber of the temple — weighing the voices of the past according to distance in time?

**Acharya Anvaya**: Precisely. If the kernel is exponential, we hear short-lived echoes: the classical Maxwell-type models. But experiments with polymers show something subtler: a **power-law decay** of memory,  
$$
G(t-\tau) \sim (t-\tau)^{-\alpha}, \quad 0<\alpha<1.
$$

**Ananya**: A power law! Then stress never completely forgets — the ancient echoes fade slowly, but they never vanish.

**Acharya Anvaya**: Well said. Substituting this kernel transforms the constitutive relation into:  
$$
\sigma(t) = \eta_\alpha \, D_t^\alpha \varepsilon(t),
$$
where $D_t^\alpha$ is a **fractional derivative** of the strain.

**Ananya**: Then when $\alpha=0$, the memory is eternal — purely elastic. When $\alpha=1$, memory vanishes quickly — purely viscous. And for $0<\alpha<1$, we have viscoelasticity, with fading memory that bridges the two.

**Acharya Anvaya**: Exactly! Thus, the language of *fractional calculus* is the scripture that describes memory in matter — echoing from the temple walls into the world of flowing polymers.
