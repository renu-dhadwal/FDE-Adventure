### Scene: Arrival at the Temple

Ananya and Acharya Anvaya stand before the **Temple of Smriti (Memory)**. Its walls glow faintly with carved verses. Above the arch is inscribed:  

*"कालः स्मृतिर्नित्यं — Kālaḥ Smṛtir Nityaṁ (Time is eternal memory)."*

## First Steps: Repeated Integration and the Cauchy Formula

**Ananya**{.student}: Acharya, this place feels mysterious. What lies in this temple?  

**Acharya Anvaya**{.teacher}: This is the Temple of Smriti, or memory. It contains the secrets of memory, the key to which lies in the idea of the *fractional integral*.  

**Ananya**{.student}: Hmm… the integral is by itself a sort of memory, isn’t it? When we integrate a function from \(0\) to \(t\):  

$$
I^1 f(t) = \int_{0}^{t} f(\tau)\, d\tau
$$

we are collecting its entire past. This is a kind of memory, isn’t it?  

**Acharya Anvaya**{.teacher}: You are absolutely right, Ananya! But before the temple reveals its secret, let us recall what happens when we integrate repeatedly.  

**Question**: What is the integral of \(1\)?  

**Ananya**{.student}:  

$$
I^1 (1)(t) = \int_0^t 1\, d\tau = t.
$$

**Acharya Anvaya**{.teacher}: Good. And integrating once more?  

**Ananya**{.student}:  

$$
I^2 (1)(t) = \int_0^t I^1(1)(\tau)\, d\tau = \int_0^t \tau\, d\tau = \frac{t^2}{2!}.
$$

**Acharya Anvaya**{.teacher}: And once more?  

**Ananya** {.student}:  

$$
I^3 (1)(t) = \int_0^t I^2(1)(\tau)\, d\tau = \int_0^t \frac{\tau^2}{2}\, d\tau = \frac{t^3}{3!}.
$$

**Acharya Anvaya**{.teacher}: Yes! We can continue like this, and the \(n^{th}\) integral can be written using the *Cauchy formula for repeated integration*:  

$$
I^n f(t) = \frac{1}{(n-1)!} \int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\,n-1} f(\tau)\, d\tau.
$$

## Memory in the Fractional Integral

**Acharya Anvaya**{.teacher}: Just as the *smriti* texts preserve memory across centuries, a fractional integral preserves traces of all past values of a function. But the weight of remembrance fades, just as stories fade with time.  

### Scene: Definition on the Temple Wall

The wall glows and reveals:  

$$
(I^\alpha f)(t) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\alpha-1} f(\tau)\, d\tau.
$$

**Acharya Anvaya**{.teacher}: We just replace factorials by the Gamma function to continue to fractional orders.  

**Ananya**{.student}: So the past influences the present, but the farther back in time we go, the weaker its pull?  

**Acharya Anvaya**{.teacher}: Precisely. Like the echo of a conch in the Himalayas — recent notes ring loud, but the first strike still whispers faintly.

## Mini-Quest 1: The Half-Memory

Evaluate \((I^{1/2} 1)(t)\).  

**Answer**:  

$$
(I^{1/2} 1)(t) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\, t^{1/2}.
$$

**Acharya Anvaya**{.teacher}: Well done, Ananya. You have grasped the essence of fractional memory. You now hold the **Key of Smriti (Memory)**. With it, the temple doors open to the next journey.  

The fractional integral is like oral tradition: newer retellings weigh more, but the first telling is never fully erased.  

A smaller \(\alpha\) preserves distant past more strongly — like stories handed down for centuries.  
A larger \(\alpha\) emphasizes the near past — like yesterday’s lived experiences.  

---

## Mini-Quest 2: Comparing Memories

Which value of \(\alpha\) remembers the distant past most strongly?  

\begin{itemize}
  \item Choice A: \(\alpha = 0.2\)  
  \item Choice B: \(\alpha = 0.5\)  
  \item Choice C: \(\alpha = 0.9\)  
\end{itemize}

**Ananya**{.student}: Since the kernel is \((t-\tau)^{\alpha - 1}\), smaller \(\alpha\) means slower decay. So the answer is A.  

**Acharya Anvaya**{.teacher}: Correct. You understand how the depth of memory depends on \(\alpha\). The temple blesses you with wisdom for the journey ahead.

### Narrator

**Narrator**{.narrator}: With the Key of Smriti in hand, Ananya steps through the temple gates. The path ahead leads to the **River of Derivatives**…
